He treats her much better than Jess does, and doesn't cheat on her or with her.\", u\"I agree! Marty had the best qualities of at least Dean, and Jess. He was sweet and thoughtful like Dean. But not too clingy. He didn't try to ruin or get in the middle of her relationship with Dean when they got back together like Jess would have. But he was smart like Jess, and could keep Rory on her toes without being an ass about it. \", u'The way Marty acts in S7 is basically non-canon to me. It\\'s totally inconsistent with his character, and if you listen to the Gilmore Guys ep where they have Wayne on it\\'s pretty obvious he feels the same way.\\n\\nThat said, Marty\\'s my favorite of Rory\\'s \"suitors\". He\\'s nice, real, honest, but not obsessive. His worst trait I guess would be he\\'s a bit self-pitying. Also the fact that his dad is his uncle and vice-versa is pretty hilarious.', u\"Except we don't know what Marty would be like with Rory. It's nice to say that he'd be her best suitor but a lot of Rory's boyfriend's weird creepy behavior didn't know until after they started dating so who knows how strange Marty really is. \"]\n"
